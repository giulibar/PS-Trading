# PancakeSwap-Trading-Bot
A script that interacts with the PanckakeSwap router using Web3 and trade tokens directly from the pool. It can be integrated with other tools

1) Change the name of the file to .env and modify the parameters, your private key is secured as it's an environmental variable, don't share it with anyone
2) Run node bot.js and get the txn hash, look at it at bscscan
3) Integrate the script with some bot to make atuomatic purchases for trading or other stuff
